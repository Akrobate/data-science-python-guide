# Installing Keras Deep learning env

## Creating specific conda env (optional)

If you are using anaconda with conda package and env manager you can start by creating the dedicated environment.

```bash
# Creating new conda env with python 3.6
conda create -n deeplearning python=3.6 anaconda

# Activating the freshly created env
conda activate deeplearning
```

## Installing modules

```bash
conda install theano
conda install tensorflow
conda install keras

# Update freshly installed modules
conda update --all
```
